            <h1 id="ch1">Mahabaratham- Part- 1 Introduction </h1>
            <p>
                The story of Mahabaratham has been written so many times by so many persons. I would like to join them. Hence the venture. One might wonder what is the need for this venture. My grandson ArvindRajaraman who shows interest in our epics is residing abroad. He is missing the great opportunity of learning our epics as part of school studies. Hence ,I would like to write this great story in a style which he would prefer to read. I always feel that our epics have great messages hidden . They tell the morals of life with sugar coated words. Why should our kids miss that? Hence this venture . There might arise a question as if the epics did really happen? All the more with Mahabaratha as Lord Krishna comes as God here . In Ramayana Lord Vishnu took the avatar as any other human being and went through the hardships which we face. In Mahabaratha, Lord Krishna an incarnation of Vishnu , performs Godly acts which some people find it hard to believe. I would remind them that Krishna avatar was in Dwapara Yuga*. As we are in Kali Yuga* we are not aware of how the universe was, technology prevailed etc………in Dwapara Yuga. So I would think it is improper to comment on something of which we have no knowledge. Any way this book is not an effort to make people believe epics or Mahabaratha. Iam writing this story for persons who believe in our epics and ofcourse who believe in Hindu divinity.

            <h1 id="ch2">Chapter2-King Shantanu</h1>
            <p>
                Let me start the story from king Shantanu. King Shantanu, his predecessors and his succesors belong to Chandra vamsa. King Shantanu was the king of Hastinapuram. The whole story revolves round this famous city and its throne. This city is situated on the banks of river Ganges. The archeological department now has traced this city, from excavations. This city according to archeological survey was in present UttarPradesh, more precisely around 37km from Meerut and 106 Km northeast of Delhi. mapancient CLICK ON THE MAP TO MAGNIFY.MAP COURTESY- HINDUSUTRA.COM. You can see Hasthinapuram and its surrounding kingdoms. The names of which you will come to know as you read the story. Once Shantanu, the young king fell in love with a pretty woman and he asked for her hand in marriage. The lady was none other than the river Ganges, in the form of a pretty lady. Ganges accepted the prince’s request , but she laid a condition, that King Shantanu should not question her for her actions ,what so ever. If he questions her , the very moment Ganges will leave him. King Shantanu readily agreed and married the beautiful Ganges. she became the queen . The happy king ruled the kingdom much to everyone’s satisfaction. After some days…….. The queen gave birth to a beautiful prince. The whole kingdom was in a happy mood. Celeberations started in the kingdom ,on the arrival of their new born prince . But alas……all their happiness vanished soon. The queen threw the prince in the river Ganges. Everyone felt sad and the king found no words to express his grief. But he could not question the queen, as the king had given a promise to the queen that he will not question her for her actions. Though Sad , the king was helpless . After some time the queen gave birth to another prince. Again the queen threw this prince also into the river. Not only this prince but also five more princes , she gave birth to, were thrown into the river. Though king Shantanu was in profound grief, he was simply watching this . For fear of losing the queen , he did not question the queen about her actions. On the birth of the eighth prince, the queen as usual was walking towards the river to throw away the newborn prince . At this, Shantanu not able to control himself,called the queen. ” Ganga” he called. The queen turned around and looked at the king. Hesitantaly, the king asked,” Why do you throw all our new born babies into the river.? ” Immediately, Ganges said, ” You had broken your promise . So, I have to leave now.I shall not kill this boy, but take him with me. I shall bring him back to you when he is a young lad.” and not waiting for a reply, the queen vanished with her son. The actual reason for Ganga’s hateful actions was that she relieved the Ashta Vasus of their sins and sent them back to heaven. Ashta Vasus are attendants of lord Indra.They are eight elemental gods (called “Aṣṭa-vasu”, ‘Eight Vasus’) representing aspects of nature, representing cosmic natural phenomenon. Once these Vasus along with their wives, were going through a forest.There they saw a beautiful cow in the hermit of Sage Vasishtar. Wife of one Vasu wanted to have the cow for herself. Her husband to fulfil her wish stole the cow with the help of his brothers( vasus) . The sage with his yogic vision , found that the vasus stole the cow. Immediately he cursed them to be born on earth as humans. The vasus repented for their actions. After much pleading, the Sage grant them a relief measure. All of them, he said, will be born on earth, but they will die wtihin a year of their birth, except the one who stole the cow . He should continue to live as per the curse.* So, the seven vasus were killed by Ganges as soon as they were born. And this last vasu is now the eighth son of King Shantanu and Ganges . As per the curse of the sage, he continues to live. His name is Devavirathan. This young lad later on became the famous ” Bhishma”.

            <p>
                Shantanu continued to rule the kingdom after Ganga left him. Years rolled by. One day when the king was taking a stroll along the river side , he saw the river water level suddenly being very low. Wondering about this low level of river water, he continued to walk. There in the river he saw a row of arrows tied so closely to each other , that the water was not able to run through. When he was admiring at the archery talent , there appeared Ganga and walked towards the king. Along with her , a young lad was walking. As she reached the king, she turned towards the king and said,” Here is our son,Devavirathan.” bhishma She asked Devavirathan to pay his respects to his father. Devavirathan obediently bowed before the king, his father. Ganga continued,” O, King, as I had promised to you , I had brought up our son as a boy who excels in archery. He had his education, from none other than, the great sage Parasuraman. You can now take him with you. ” She hugged her beloved son Devavirathan, and also promised him that she would appear before him, whenever he feels like meeting his mother. With these words , she left. King Shanthanu overwhelming with joy, hugged his son and took him to the palace. News spread of the arrival of the prince and the kingdom rejoiced with happiness. Prince Devavirathan actively particicpitated on matters of governance. King found him perfectly fit to succeed him. After some days………. King Shantanu was travelling in his chariot. On the bank of a river, King Shantanu saw a beautiful woman and he lost his heart for her. She is a fisherwoman and she was earning her livelihood by helping people to cross the river with her boat. She oars them up and down the river.Her name is Sathyavati and her dad is the head of fishermen. When King Shantanu asked for her hand in marriage, she said politely,” You have to get permission form my dad. If my father accepts for this marriage , I shall marry you.” , The next day the king went to meet the fishermen head asking for his daughter Sathyati’s hand in marriage. On hearing this, Sathyavati’s father was very happy as his daughter will become the queen of Hastinapuram. But he laid a condition,” I want a promise from you, that the son born to Sathyavati, should succeed you as the next king. If you can give me that promise, I find no reason to stop you from marrying my daughter to you.” King Shantanu was taken aback by this. condition . He did not give the promise and left the place in vain. He tried to forget Sathyavati. But he was not able to forget and his mindset started to tell on his health. Seeing his father’s bad health, prince Devavirathan was worried a lot. He tried to find out the reason from his dad , but could not. With the help of the king’s subjects, he finally found out the reason. He thought it is his duty to make his father happy . Straight he went to meet Sathyavati’s father , and told him that he shall promise to denounce the throne. At this the tribal king said,” Iam happy that you promise not to suceed the throne. But after your marriage, your children might claim their right for the throne.That will affect my daughter and my grandchildren’s respects in the kingdom. Again that bothers me.” For this Devavirathan looking up to the heaven and took a vow. ” As the heaven and the gods stand as a witness, I hereby vow that I shall sacrifice my crown-prince title and will not marry . But remain in the kingdom and take care of Hastinapuram and its king till I die.” The gods were happy and there were utterances from every where ” Bhishma …Bhishma…..Bhishma…” His father king Shantanu also gave him the boon of Ichcha Mrityu (control over his own death — he could choose the time of his death, but he was not immortal.). (Bhishma means He of the terrible oath, referring to his vow of lifelong celibacy. Originally named Devavratha, he became known as Bhishma after he took the bhishma pratigya (‘terrible oath’) — the vow of lifelong celibacy and of service to whoever sat on the throne of Hastinapur*) King Shantanu married Sathyavati. They had two sons, Vichitraveeryan, Chitrangadhan.

            <h1 id="ch4">Chapter4-Dhirithirashtran and Pandu</h1>
            <p>Both the princes, Chitrangadhan and Vichitraveeryan were growing up. Some years later…….King Shantanu died. Chitrangadhan then ascended the throne. As a king he had to fight in wars. And in one such war Chitrangadhan died. Now Vichitraveeryan ascended the throne. Time came to perform marriage for him. Both Bhishma and Satyavathi were looking for a right princess to marry Vichitraveeryan. Bhishma came to know of the svayamvara of the kingdom of the three Kasi princess. Bhishma went to Kasi. Even before the Svayamvara ritual started , he brought all the three princess( Amba, Ambika & Ambalika)n to Hastinapuram to get them married to Vichitraveeryan. The eldest princess ,Amba prayed to Bhishma to let her go away , as she was in love with the prince of Salva kingdom. She was allowed to go. But Salva prince refused to marry her now, as she was kidnapped for another man. So, she rushed back to Hastinapuram and asked Bhishma to marry her. But Bhishma , explained about his vow and refused to marry her. At this she was angry with him for disturbing her life. She took a pledge that Bhishma will die by her hand as she had to face so much grief becuase of his kidnapping . ( This princess Amba, in her rebirth was born as Sikandi to king Durupadha. She was responsible for the death of Bhishma in the great Kurukshetra war.) Ambika and Ambalika got married to Vichitraveeryan. ( In those days it is common for kings to marry more than one woman). Days went by. Due to ill health Vichitraveeryan died without leaving a heir behind. Sathyavati asked Bhishma to ascend the throne and get married. But Bhishma stood by his vow and turned down his stepmother’s wish. Now , Sathyavati asked sage Vyasar to bless Ambika and Ambalika with children. Ambika gave birth to a blind son ‘Dhrithiirashtran’ and Ambalika gave birth to son ‘Pandu’. Their domestic help also gave birth to a son ‘Vidhuran’ by the sage’s blessings.(Vidhuran later on became the wise minister in Dhirithirastran’s court.) All the three sons grew up to be a young lad. They were made to learn befitting their talents and capacities. Each one excelled in one field. When the ripe time came , Sathyavati and Bhishma discussed about whom should ascend the throne of Hastinapuram. They then decided to take the help of Viduran who is a wise man. He said as per the law( then) a blind man, though elder, cannot become the king. And, so Pandu should be crowned as the King. Then it was decided to make Pandu the king of Hastinapuram. this decision made Dhrithirashtran feel very unhappy , though he did not let out his feelings. On an auspicious day, Pandu was made the king. Vidhuran became the prime minister in his court. Dhrithirastran was given a respectable place in the court.

                Pandu became the king of Hastinapuram and was ruling the kingdom with his brother Dhirithirashtran in the court. Sathyavati and Bheeshma decided to get both the princes married. Bheeshma learnt about the princess of Kandahar (now in Afghanistan), Gandhari. He went and asked the Kandahar king’s approval for Gandhari, to marry Dhirithirashtran. The king was aware of Dhirithirashtran’s blindness . Though the king was not ready to accept this offer from Bheeshmar, in the best interest of his kingdom, he agreed. But the prince of Kandahar ,Shakuni , brother of Gandhari did not really like to get his beautiful sister married to a blind man. He tried to convince the king to change his decision. But for the fear of facing enmity with the mighty Bheeshmar , the king agreed for the marriage of Gandhari with Dhirithirashtran. At first Gandhari was not aware of Dhirithirashtran’s blindness. But when she came to know of his blindness , she was not sad about that. But she decided to cover her eyes with a piece of cloth , as she decided not to see anything which her husband will miss. And Gandhari happily married Dhirithirashtran. Shakuni felt bad that his beautiful sister had to marry a blind man. He thought that the might of Hastinapuram and the mighty Bheeshma , were the only reason for his sister’s marriage . So,with vengance he took a vow that he will bring down the mighty Kuru dynasty. (King Chandanu and his descendents belongs to this Kuru dynasty/ Chandra vamsam.) (This prince Shakuni later on became the architect of the famous Kurukshetra war.) King Pandu got married to Kunti and Madri .Madri was the princess of Madra Kingdom. Kunti was the adopted daughter of Kunti Bhojan. She was the biological daughter of king Surasena.But became an adopted daughter of Kunti Bhojan. Kunti is also the sister of Vasudevar…..Yes father of Lord Krishna. To Know more about Kunti ,her early life and about Krishna , we have to do a little back in time.We had to go Shurasena, then to Mathura, from Mathura to Gokulam and then we shall return back to Hastinapuram.
